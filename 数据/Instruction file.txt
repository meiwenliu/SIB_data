    Each folder contains discharge data of 1500mAh sodium-ion batteries with corresponding serial numbers under different operating conditions. The folder names are formatted as the battery serial number followed by the set ambient temperature, and the file suffixes indicate the discharge rates at which the data was collected. The DST files in the Cell1 and Cell2 folders refer to the battery data under dynamic charge-discharge conditions.
